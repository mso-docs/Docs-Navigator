AuroraAI Technical Report

AuroraAI is an enterprise-grade multimodal assistant designed for
documentation, engineering analysis, and workflow automation.

Core Capabilities

-   Long-context reasoning (200k tokens)
-   Code generation and API reasoning
-   Retrieval-augmented responses
-   Document drafting, editing, and summarization
-   Secure, role-based enterprise integration

Architecture Summary

AuroraAI is a 70B-parameter transformer model featuring: - Hierarchical
and sliding-window attention mechanisms - 8192-dimensional hidden
layers - 96 transformer blocks - 64 attention heads - SwiGLU-activated
feed-forward networks - Rotary positional embeddings with extended
scaling

Training Methodology

AuroraAI was trained using: - Autoregressive next-token prediction - A
mixture of technical documentation, code corpora, research texts, RFCs,
and synthetic alignment sets - AdamW optimization with warmup and cosine
decay - Distributed training across 1024–4096 GPUs - BF16
mixed-precision gradient computation - Redundant asynchronous
checkpointing

Evaluation Results

-   HumanEval+ accuracy: 86%
-   Document QA improvement: +22% over baseline
-   Retrieval fidelity: 99% at 200k-token context
-   Hallucination rate reduction: 38% via strict retrieval routing

Safety & Alignment

AuroraAI employs: - Supervised fine-tuning on technical reasoning
tasks - Reinforcement learning from human preferences - Multi-layer
content filtering - Policy-driven guardrails engine - Encrypted opt-in
user memory with immediate deletion controls

Intended Use Cases

AuroraAI performs best in: - Developer documentation workflows - API
lifecycle and architectural content creation - Engineering ticket
summarization - Knowledge retrieval from large document bases -
Enterprise search and analysis tasks

Limitations

AuroraAI is not optimized for: - Unsupervised high-risk autonomous
decision making - Medical, legal, or hazardous domain outputs without
human review - Context-free speculation or queries lacking grounding
data
